You are generating RUNNABLE code for MY MACHINE. Follow the CONTRACT exactly.

CONTEXT:
- OS: Windows 11 Pro
- Shell: PowerShell 7 (pwsh)
- Git installed. Docker optional. No WSL.

CONTRACT — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
1) Output a SINGLE-FILE PoC that runs end-to-end and a SMOKE TEST entrypoint.
2) Provide Windows-first commands in PowerShell. If you include bash, also provide pwsh equivalents.
3) Pin versions in requirements.txt / package.json. No placeholders, no “...”.
4) Include sample data or `--demo` mode and show expected SMOKE pass criteria.
5) Add Preflight: assert tool versions and print them; fail early with actionable errors.
6) Prohibit fictional APIs. If external API is essential, include a local mock and a safe install plan.
7) End with: Known Limitations, Next Steps, Confidence (H/M/L) + Assumptions.

MACHINE PROFILE (from live discovery):
- OS: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro v10.0.26100 (64-bit) host:CNC-1 CPU:Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-14900K cores:32 RAM:63.72GB
- Python: in_path=True version= pip_in_path=False pip_version=
- Node: in_path=True version= npm_in_path=False npm_version=
- .NET: in_path=True sdk_version=
- Git: in_path=True version=
- GPU: nvidia_smi=True cuda= driver=
- Package Managers: winget=True choco=True scoop=False

HARD RULES:
- Only use toolchains/versions present above; if a missing dependency is essential, output a SAFE install plan (winget search + pip/npm lines) before code, do not assume it's available.
- Windows 11 + PowerShell 7 only.
DELIVERABLES (Node 20 ESM):
- File: app.mjs (ESM only)
- package.json with exact pins and "test" script (node:test or vitest)
- Implement `--preflight`, `--demo`, `--smoke`; mock any external APIs
- Provide PowerShell commands: npm ci; node app.mjs --preflight / --demo / --smoke; npm test

TASK:
Create a single-file Node 20 ESM script app.mjs that:
- reads .\data\demo.json (or creates it on --demo) with an array of job objects
- normalizes keys to: {id, width_in, height_in, material}
- prints a summary report to stdout (count, min/max area)
- implements --preflight (node/npm version print), --demo, --smoke (assert count>=3)
- includes package.json with exact pins and a node:test that verifies area calc

SELF-CONSISTENCY CHECK (silent before return):
- Code parses for specified versions.
- All imports installed/pinned and used.
- Entrypoint + PowerShell commands match filenames.
- Windows path quoting correct; CRLF/LF handled.
- Smoke exits 0 on pass.
