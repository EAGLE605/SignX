**COST SUMMARY AUDIT PROMPT**

**Context:**
I am an estimator for Eagle Sign Company in Grimes, Iowa working on a national account program. I need to audit and adjust pricing as it has been over 1 year since the last pricing adjustment for material and labor costs. Sales commission is 4% of the final sale price.

**What I'm uploading:**
Cost summaries from the last 5 completed jobs for [Product Name - Part #XXX-XXXX]. These jobs are identical in materials/specifications—only labor and material costs may have changed.

**PRODUCT-SPECIFIC SHIPPING QUANTITIES:**
- **Standard 5x20 Signs, Hurricane 5x20 Signs, High Wind 5x20 Signs, Intercom Signs:** 1 unit (crated)
- **All Poles (Standard, High Wind, Hurricane - both intercom and non-intercom):** 1 unit each
- **5x20 Faces:** Sold as sets (1 Enter + 1 Do Not Enter face) for field replacements
- **Intercom Sign Faces:** 2 faces per sign (1 Guarantee/rear + 1 Instruction/front)
- **5x20 NRG LED Conversion Kit:** 20 units per pallet
- **Intercom Sign NRG LED Conversion Kit:** 70 units per pallet

**IMPORTANT ANALYSIS NOTES:**
- **Always use job actuals for material costs** - ignore any mention of "updated system pricing"
- **Minimum Shipment Quantity:** [State specific quantity based on product type above]

**What I need you to analyze:**

**Labor Audit:**
- Extract actual labor hours by work code for each job
- Calculate labor hours per unit across all jobs
- Identify all work codes used and flag any unusual/unexpected codes
- Determine if there are learning curve effects or efficiency trends
- Flag any outliers for my review and guidance on how to proceed
- Recommend new labor standards based on actual performance (use worst-case for shipping/crating codes)

**Material Cost Analysis:**
- Extract material qty and cost per unit for each job using actual job costs only
- Identify any price changes or variances between jobs
- Calculate weighted average material cost per unit based on actual job performance
- Include all shipping/packaging materials allocated per minimum shipment quantity
- Note any changes in burden rates between jobs and recommend standard burden percentage

**Single-Shipment Protection:**
- Base all calculations on stated minimum shipment quantity
- Ensure shipping materials (lumber, boxes, wrap, etc.) are fully allocated per minimum shipment
- Use worst-case labor cycles, not averages, for shipping/crating work codes

**Discrepancy Handling:**
- Flag any data point (labor hours, material cost, work code usage) more than 20% above/below average
- Do not exclude outliers automatically - flag them for my review and guidance
- Clearly document all flagged items with specific questions for my input
- Note recurring patterns and document potential causes

**Chronological Analysis:**
- Analyze jobs in chronological order to identify time-based trends
- Note any efficiency improvements or cost escalations over time
- Weight more recent jobs higher in recommendations if clear trends exist

**Output Format Required:**
Format results EXACTLY like Eagle Sign Company cost summaries with:
- Same header format (RUN DATE: [Current Date] Eagle Sign Company PAGE 1)
- Work order summary showing TOTAL MATERIAL COST, TOTAL LABOR COST, TOTAL BURDEN COST, TOTAL COST
- Labor section with work codes, EST vs ACTUAL hours, costs, and variances
- Material section with part numbers, descriptions, U/M, quantities, and costs
- Show "CURRENT STANDARDS" vs "RECOMMENDED 2025 STANDARDS"
- Include WO Qty and per-unit calculations

**Key Requirements:**
- Support all recommendations with actual job performance data
- Present as official Eagle Sign Company cost summary for 2025 standards
- Flag all outliers and unusual findings for my review
- Include summary of key changes and justification for pricing adjustments

**TEMPLATE FOR UPLOAD:**
When uploading, state: "Product: [Name] - Part #[XXX-XXXX]" and I'll apply the correct minimum shipment quantity based on the product type listed above.
