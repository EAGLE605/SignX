I need to process work order cost history data from KeyedIn with exact formatting and thorough verification. Please follow these specifications precisely:
DATA PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extract part number, description, and all work order details
2. Sort by completion date (newest to oldest) - NOT by work order number
3. Group in blocks of exactly 200 work orders (final group may have fewer)
4. Detect and remove all duplicate work order numbers
5. Calculate total quantity across all work orders with careful verification
6. Identify transitions in manufacturing processes (e.g., when outsourcing began)
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Always provide VERSION 2 of each work order group. I will specify "With quantities" when version 1 is needed:
Version 1 - For analysis (with quantities):
```
Part Number    [PART-NUMBER]
Description    [DESCRIPTION]
Total Work Orders   [COUNT]
Total Quantity [TOTAL-QTY]
Report Depth    [NEWEST-DATE] - [OLDEST-DATE]
Work Orders    [COUNT] Group [GROUP-NUM]
Group 1 Dates  [GROUP-NEWEST-DATE] - [GROUP-OLDEST-DATE]
Total Quantity [GROUP-TOTAL-QTY]
[WO-NUM]  ([QTY])
[WO-NUM]  ([QTY])
...
```
Version 2 - For KeyedIn copy/paste (without quantities):
```
Part Number    [PART-NUMBER]
Description    [DESCRIPTION]
Total Work Orders   [COUNT]
Total Quantity [TOTAL-QTY]
Report Depth    [NEWEST-DATE] - [OLDEST-DATE]
Work Orders    [COUNT] Group [GROUP-NUM]
Group 1 Dates  [GROUP-NEWEST-DATE] - [GROUP-OLDEST-DATE]
[WO-NUM]
[WO-NUM]
...
```
CRITICAL: Always present each formatted block inside triple backtick code blocks (```) to preserve exact spacing and monospaced formatting. Each group must be in its own separate code block for easy copy/paste into KeyedIn.
VERIFICATION: Double-check all quantity totals and work order counts. If you're uncertain about any calculations, explain your process and verify the numbers twice.
I'll paste my work order cost history data for you to process according to these exact specifications.
