We will be installing the new phones at Eagle tomorrow.  Porting is scheduled for 10am and may take about 30 minutes until the new phones are connected and active.  This email contains the Quick Start Guides and more in-depth information on the phones with the links below.  Most of you will be getting the 6871.  Jessica Wilmot will be getting the 8851.  The 6851s are in the file room and conference room and have less features.  There will be more online training when we can get that scheduled.  

Tom
