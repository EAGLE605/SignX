PERFORMANCE TESTING
==================================================

Testing CorelDRAW VBA performance...

TEST 1: Creating 100 shapes
Time taken: 0.01 seconds
Shapes per second: 8533

OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
• Always use Application.Optimization = True
• Group operations with BeginCommandGroup
• Process shapes in batches
• Avoid selecting/deselecting in loops
• Use shape ranges for multiple operations

LIMITS:
• Reasonable limit: 1000-5000 shapes
• Complex paths may slow down
• Large bitmaps use more memory
