"Access Denied" Error:

- Verify VPN is connected
- Check with IT for permissions

"Cannot find network path":
- VPN not connected
- Server might be down
- Firewall blocking connection

H: drive issues:
- Path might be \\ES-FS02\users\[yourusername]
- Check exact path when remoted into work PC

Sync taking too long:
- First sync always takes hours
- Later syncs are much faster
- Check logs in C:\WorkSync\Logs\

=========================================
