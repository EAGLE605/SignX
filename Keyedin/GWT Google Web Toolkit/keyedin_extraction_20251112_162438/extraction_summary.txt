The extraction script has successfully:
✓ Authenticated with KeyedIn
✓ Connected to Informer API
✓ Discovered available reports

To extract actual data, we need to:
1. Build getData payloads for each specific report
2. Parse the GWT RPC response format for data rows
3. Handle pagination for large datasets

This is excellent progress! Authentication is complete.
