## **CONTINUATION PROMPT**
```
Continue documenting my sign shop workflow. Current state: Valley Church file (0725-39657.cdr) is open in CorelDRAW, zoomed out showing all versions. The circled version shows 22" height.

Task: Document my scale verification process. When I measure the 22" text with CorelDRAW's ruler, it shows 5.5" on screen.
```

---

## **IF CONTEXT LOST**
"Check project knowledge. I'm Brady. We're at CorelDRAW scale verification. File is 0725-39657.cdr, shows 22" but measures 5.5" on screen."

---

## **REMEMBER**
- This is YOUR actual workflow
- No theoretical additions
- 15-45 minutes is real constraint
- Everything in one CDR file
- Scale is NEVER 1:1
