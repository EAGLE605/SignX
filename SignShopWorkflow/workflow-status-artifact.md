# **WORKFLOW DOCUMENTATION STATUS - DETAILED VERSION**

## **EXACTLY WHERE WE STOPPED**

### **Current Screen State in CorelDRAW:**
- **File Open**: `Valley Church Halo Flange Letters Front Elev 0725-39657.cdr`
- **Font Dialog**: Clicked OK (you said "clicking okay because it doesnt matter right now")
- **View**: ZOOMED ALL THE WAY OUT (your words: "zoom allll the way out")
- **What's Visible**:
  - Multiple versions of Valley Church sign scattered around
  - Photos of the actual building (for installation reference)
  - "BRADY TAKEOFF" section (that's YOU)
  - One version is CIRCLED (you said: "hey look! its circled this time")
  - Various test versions and revisions CRN saved

### **Key Details About This File:**
- Designer: CRN (saves everything in one file)
- Drawing shows: 1.83' × 13.6' = 24.9 SQ FT
- Actual dimensions: 22" height × 13'7" width
- Your comment: "due to how many reveisions and other art CRN needed to play with"

## **WHAT'S FULLY DOCUMENTED (With Your Corrections)**

### **✅ Phase 0: Email Discovery**
- You corrected me: "Email is the TRUE starting point"
- Outlook folder structure: BID REQUEST → Jeff/Joe/Rich/Mike E
- All folders equal priority (you corrected my assumption)
- "BID REQUEST" is the keyword

### **✅ Phase 1: KeyedIn Login**
- URL: `https://eaglesign.keyedinsign.com/cgi-bin/mvi.exe/LOGIN.START`
- Dark gray menu (#505050)
- Widgets show "No Tasks currently assigned"

### **✅ Phase 2: Contact Management**
- JavaScript function: `openNew('CONTACT.MANAGEMENT','CRM.STD')`
- Opens in NEW TAB (not same window)
- Search already set to "Quote Number"

### **✅ Phase 3: Quote List Analysis**
- "Show Quotes" opens ANOTHER popup
- Complex case: Quote 38092 has SO# but customer changed mind
- Only "BID REQUEST" status matters for estimation

### **✅ Phase 4: Attachment Analysis**
- Attachments tab is CRITICAL
- Determines software choice
- Your rule: "Nagle Signs is NOTORIOUS for sending up raster images"

### **✅ Phase 5: File System Navigation**
- G:\[First Letter]\[Customer Name]\
- Your description: "kind of a mess and tricky to navigate"
- Warning: "MAKE SURE YOURE GRABBING OR MEASURING THE CORRECT ONE"

### **✅ Phase 6: CorelDRAW Opening**
- Font substitution dialog (always click OK)
- Must zoom out to see everything
- CRN saves all versions in one file

## **WHAT'S NOT YET DOCUMENTED**

### **❌ Scale Verification (NEXT STEP!)**
- You said: "bluebeam AND coreldraw...you must make sure all drawings are scaled FULL SIZE or do the math"
- Drawing shows 22" but measures 5.5" on screen
- Need to document scale factor calculation (4x in this case)
- CRN "pretty spot on with scaling" but still must verify

### **❌ Dimension Extraction**
What you need to extract after scaling:
- Letter spacing (you said: "will never be called out")
- Individual letter heights in stacked designs
- Logo widths (your example: "height is called out for the logo at 17.25" but not the width")
- Return depths from side profile

### **❌ Eagle Template Macros**
- How to identify if template exists
- How to run the macro
- What it calculates automatically

### **❌ Bluebeam Workflow**
- Full calibration process
- You said: "NEVER trust typed scale"
- Measurement tools
- Export process

### **❌ Material Calculations**
- Channel letter materials
- Monument sign materials
- LED calculations
- Mounting hardware

### **❌ Excel Pricing Integration**
- How measurements become dollars
- Labor calculations
- Material markups
- Final quote assembly

### **❌ Closing the Loop**
- Entering estimate back in KeyedIn
- Communicating to sales team
- Status update from BID REQUEST to BID COMPLETED

## **KEY DISCOVERIES FROM OUR SESSION**

### **1. The Email Reality**
- I completely missed this was email-first
- You corrected me about folder priorities
- Mike E retired but folder remains

### **2. The Quote Complexity**
- Customer can change mind after approval (38092)
- Some quotes already in production can't change
- Multiple quotes for same job common

### **3. The File Mess**
- No standard naming convention
- Multiple versions in same folder
- Some files just named with quote number
- Must find CORRECT, Verified, VALIDATED drawing

### **4. The Scale Truth**
- NEVER imports at 1:1
- Must verify even with "accurate" designers
- One dimension given, extract the rest
- Your quote: "you'll have enough to scale and one dimension or the other"

### **5. The Designer Patterns**
- CRN saves everything in one file
- Usually circles the final version
- Pretty accurate with scales
- Forgets dimensions like letter spacing

## **CRITICAL QUOTES FROM YOU**

1. **On Software Choice**: "if it was a raster image i would use bluebeam as there is no eagle .cdr or .ai    Nagle Signs is NOTORIOUS for sending up raster images in pdf"

2. **On File Selection**: "MAKE SURE YOURE GRABBING OR MEASURING THE CORRECT ONE THAT MATCHES DIMENSIONS OF THE SKETCH ATTACHED TO THE QUOTE!"

3. **On Scale**: "youre not going to find it at full scale imported"

4. **On Dimensions**: "letter spacing will never be called out"

5. **On Workflow**: "so describe up to this point IN PRECISE DETAIL what my workflow is"

## **YOUR ACTUAL TOOLS**

- **Outlook**: Email organization
- **Chrome**: For KeyedIn (multiple tabs/popups)
- **KeyedIn**: Legacy CRM (no API)
- **Windows Explorer**: G: drive navigation
- **Adobe Reader**: PDF viewing
- **CorelDRAW 2021**: Vector estimation
- **Bluebeam Revu**: Raster estimation
- **Excel**: Final pricing (implied)

## **TIME INVESTMENT**

You stated: **"15-45 minutes per quote"**

This is the target timeframe for the complete workflow from email to ready-for-pricing.

## **NEXT SESSION MUST DOCUMENT**

### **Priority 1: Scale Verification in CorelDRAW**
- Measure the 22" height on screen (shows as 5.5")
- Calculate scale factor (4x)
- Apply to all measurements
- Show common scale conversions

### **Priority 2: Measurement Extraction**
- What CRN didn't dimension
- How to find missing measurements
- Creating measurement notes in BRADY TAKEOFF section

### **Priority 3: Complete One Full Example**
