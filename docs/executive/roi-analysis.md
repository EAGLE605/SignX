### Annual Time Savings

**Assumptions:**
- Projects per year: 500
- Average hourly rate: $100/hour
- Time saved per project: 5.08 hours

**Calculation:**
```
500 projects × 5.08 hours = 2,540 hours saved/year
2,540 hours × $100/hour = $254,000/year
```

### Efficiency Improvements

- **Throughput**: 4 hours/project → 15 minutes/project = **16x improvement**
- **Capacity**: Can handle 4x more projects with same staff
- **Scalability**: No linear cost increase with volume

## Error Reduction Savings

### Legacy Error Rate

- **Calculation Errors**: 5-10% of projects
- **Error Correction Cost**: 2 hours/project × $100/hour = $200/project
- **Annual Error Cost**: 500 projects × 7.5% error rate × $200 = **$7,500/year**

### APEX Error Rate

- **Calculation Errors**: <0.1% (deterministic calculations)
- **Error Correction Cost**: Minimal (automated validation)
- **Annual Error Cost**: 500 projects × 0.1% × $50 = **$25/year**

**Annual Savings**: $7,500 - $25 = **$7,475**

### Risk Reduction

- **Liability Risk**: Reduced calculation errors → lower liability exposure
- **Reputation Risk**: Higher accuracy → improved customer trust
