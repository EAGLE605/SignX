# Video Script: Module 1 - System Overview

**Duration**: 10 minutes  
**Target Audience**: End users

## Script

**[0:00 - 0:30] Introduction**

"Welcome to SIGN X Studio Clone training. In this video, we'll give you an overview of the system and show you how to get started.

SIGN X Studio is a modern sign design and engineering platform that replaces the legacy CalcuSign system. It provides automated calculations, instant geometry derivations, and automated report generation."

**[0:30 - 2:00] Key Benefits**

"Let's talk about the key benefits:

First, **time savings**. Projects that used to take 4 hours now take just 15 minutes - that's a 94% reduction.

Second, **accuracy**. The system uses deterministic calculations, meaning same inputs always produce same outputs. Error rates drop from 5-10% to less than 0.1%.

Third, **full traceability**. Every calculation is logged with complete audit trails.

Fourth, **confidence scoring**. The system tells you how confident it is in each calculation, helping you decide when engineering review is needed."

**[2:00 - 4:00] Interface Tour**

"Let's take a quick tour of the interface.

[Screen capture: Navigate to project list]

This is the project list view. Here you can see all your projects, filter by status, and search.

[Click 'New Project']

When you create a project, you'll see the 8-stage stepper:

[Highlight stages]

Stage 1: Overview - Project metadata
Stage 2: Site & Environment - Address and wind data
Stage 3: Cabinet Design - Interactive canvas
Stage 4: Structural Design - Pole selection
Stage 5: Foundation Type - Choose direct burial or baseplate
Stage 6: Foundation Design - Calculate footing
Stage 7: Baseplate Design - Validate baseplate
Stage 8: Review & Submit - Final review and submission

[Point to confidence badge]

Notice the confidence badge here. Green means high confidence, yellow means medium, orange means low, and red means very low confidence requiring review."

**[4:00 - 6:00] Navigation Basics**

"Let's look at navigation:

[Open project]

When you open a project, you can see the stage stepper at the top. Click any stage to jump directly to it.

[Show canvas]

Here's the interactive canvas for cabinet design. You can draw and resize cabinets, and the system automatically calculates geometry.

[Show form inputs]

And here are the form inputs that update in real-time as you modify the canvas.

[Point to assumptions]

If there are any warnings or assumptions, they'll appear here in the assumptions panel."

**[6:00 - 8:00] Help and Support**

"Now let's talk about getting help:

[Click help icon]

The help icon gives you access to:
- Documentation
- FAQ
- Support contact

[Show documentation]

The documentation includes:
- User guides
- API reference
- Troubleshooting
- Video tutorials

[Show support]

For support, you can:
- Email support@example.com
- Check the FAQ
- Review troubleshooting guides"

**[8:00 - 9:30] Real-World Example**

"Let me show you a quick example:

[Create project]

I'll create a new project called 'Training Example'.

[Fill stages quickly]

You'll complete stages 1 through 4, entering site information, drawing a cabinet, and selecting a pole.

[Point to confidence]

Notice how the confidence score updates as you progress. Currently it's at 92% - that's excellent!

[Show submission]

When ready, you submit the project, and a PDF report is automatically generated."

**[9:30 - 10:00] Next Steps**

"That wraps up the overview. In the next video, we'll dive deep into project creation and stages 1-4.

Remember:
- System saves automatically
- Confidence scores help you make decisions
- Documentation is always available
- Support is ready to help

Thanks for watching, and let's move on to Module 2!"
